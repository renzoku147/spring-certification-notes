# Section 1-1 – Container, Dependency and IOC

• What is dependency injection and what are the advantages of using it?

• What is an interface and what are the advantages of making use of them in Java?

• What is an ApplicationContext?

• How are you going to create a new instance of an ApplicationContext?

• Can you describe the lifecycle of a Spring Bean in an ApplicationContext?

• How are you going to create an ApplicationContext in an integration test?

• What is the preferred way to close an application context? Does Spring Boot do this for you?

• Are beans lazily or eagerly instantiated by default? How do you alter this behavior?

• What is a property source? How would you use @PropertySource?

• What is a BeanFactoryPostProcessor and what is it used for? When is it invoked?

• What is a BeanPostProcessor and how is it different to a BeanFactoryPostProcessor? What do they do? When are they called?

• What does component-scanning do?

• What is the behavior of the annotation @Autowired with regards to field injection, constructor injection and method injection?

• How does the @Qualifier annotation complement the use of @Autowired?

• What is a proxy object and what are the two different types of proxies Spring can create?

• What does the @Bean annotation do?

• What is the default bean id if you only use @Bean? How can you override this?

• Why are you not allowed to annotate a final class with @Configuration

• How do you configure profiles? What are possible use cases where they might be useful?

• Can you use @Bean together with @Profile?

• Can you use @Component together with @Profile?

• How many profiles can you have?

• How do you inject scalar/literal values into Spring beans?

• What is Spring Expression Language (SpEL for short)?

• What is the Environment abstraction in Spring?

• Where can properties in the environment come from – there are many sources for properties – check the documentation if not sure. Spring Boot adds even more.

• What can you reference using SpEL?

• What is the difference between $ and # in @Value expressions?
